# AI Prompt Optimizer

An intelligent tool that evaluates and improves AI prompts using a 5-star rating system.

## What It Does
- Analyzes prompts for clarity, context, and actionability
- Provides specific improvement suggestions
- Predicts potential issues users might encounter
- Supports different use cases (coding, writing, etc.)

## Technical Challenge Solved
AI evaluation systems often have blurred rating criteria. I refined the evaluation framework to provide consistent, meaningful ratings that users can trust and act upon.
